`Version 0.5.1 - 2020-03-29 <https://pypi.org/project/creme/0.5.1/>`_
=====================================================================

:mod:`compose`

- `compose.Pipeline` and `compose.TransformerUnion` now variadic arguments as input instead of a list. This doesn't change anything when using the shorthand operators ``|`` and ``+``.

:mod:`model_selection`

- Removed ``model_selection.successive_halving``
- Added `model_selection.SuccessiveHalvingRegressor` and `model_selection.SuccessiveHalvingClassifier`

:mod:`stream`

- Added a ``copy`` parameter to `stream.simulate_qa` in order to handle unwanted feature modifications.

:mod:`tree`

- Added a ``curtail_under`` parameter to `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`.
- The speed and accuracy of both `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and `tree.RandomForestClassifier` has been slightly improved for numerical attributes.
- The esthetics of the `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.draw` method have been improved.
