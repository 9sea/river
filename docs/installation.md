# Installation

`creme` is intended to work with **Python 3.6 or above**. Installation can be done with `pip`:

```sh
pip install creme
```

There are [wheels available](https://pypi.org/project/creme/#files) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, which means that in most cases you won't have to build `creme` from source.

You can install the latest development version from GitHub as so:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/creme-ml/creme --upgrade
```

Or, through SSH:

```sh
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/creme-ml/creme.git --upgrade
```
