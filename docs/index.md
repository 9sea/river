# Welcome!

`creme` is a Python library for [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning). All the tools in the library can be updated with a single observation at a time, and can therefore be used to learn from streaming data. This is general-purpose library, and therefore caters to different machine learning problems, including regression, classification, and unsupervised learning.

We recommend that new users begin with the [getting started guide](getting-started.md). Afterwards, you can check out the [user guide](user-guide/reading-data) to learn how to properly use `creme`. It contains recipes and tutorials on how to go about doing specific tasks. The [API reference](api-reference/overview) is a catalogue of all the available modules, classes, and functions that are available. Finally, check out the [examples section](examples/batch-to-online) for comprehensive usage examples.

Feel welcome to get in touch with us if you would like to contribute. We are more than happy to onboard people. You can check out the [issue board](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/issues) for a list of things to work on. You may refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on the steps to take.
