`creme` is a Python library for [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning). All the tools in the library can be updated with a single observation at a time, and can therefore be used to learn from streaming data.

If you are a new user, then we recommend that you begin with the [getting started guide](getting-started.md). Afterwards, you can check out the [user guide](user-guide) to learn how to properly use `creme`. It contains recipes and tutorials on how to go about doing specific tasks. The [API reference](api-reference) is a catalogue of all the available modules, classes, and functions that are available. Finally, check out the [examples section](examples) for comprehensive usage examples.

Contributions are more than welcome, and we are more than happy to onboard people. You can check out the [issue board](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/issues) for a list of things to work on. You may refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on the steps to take.
