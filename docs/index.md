`creme` is a Python library for [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning). All the tools in the library can be updated with a single observation at a time, and can therefore be used to learn from streaming data.

Most of the development is coming from a group of friends from the city of Toulouse, in France. Some of us are doing a PhD, while the rest are research engineers. We are looking for more contributors and would be more than happy to onboard you. Whether you are a researcher in online learning or an enthusiastic hobbyist, feel free to get in touch. You can check out the [issue board](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/issues) for a list of things to work on. You may refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on the steps to take.
