The number of samples is adjusted so that the target distribution can be attained, either by under-sampling or over-sampling. However, you can do both at the same time and choose how much data the classifier will see. To do so, we can use the `RandomSampler` class. In addition to the desired class distribution, we can specify how much data to train on. The samples will both be under-sampled and over-sampled in order to fit your constraints. This is powerful because it allows you to control both the class distribution and the size of the training data (and thus the training time). In the following example we'll set it so that the model will train with 1 percent of the data."
