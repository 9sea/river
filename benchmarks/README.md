# Benchmarks

To run these benchmarks, navigate to this directory and create a `conda` virtual environment, as so:

```sh
conda env --name creme-benchmarks --file requirements.txt
conda activate creme-benchmarks
```

You may then run `jupyter lab` and open the notebooks.

This development version of `creme` will be installed from GitHub. You may change this behaviour by modifying `environment.yml` before creating the virtual environment.

Depending on what you want to do, you might have to run the `download_data.sh` script to obtain the necessary data.
